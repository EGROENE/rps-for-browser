# rps-for-browser
This is a personal project I completed. It is a very, very simple 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game built to operate in the web browser.
The user selects one of four options, one of which randomizes their choice and includes two additional options to the standard three, 'bomb' & 'suicide bomb', by which the user automatically wins & automatically loses, respectively.
I used HTML to structure the page, CSS to style it, & JavaScript to code the events of the game itself. Instead of creating a separate file for JavaScript, I put it all inside the script tags toward the end of the HTML file.
Feel free to go visit the link under 'Pages' to play, if you have absolutely nothing else to do.
